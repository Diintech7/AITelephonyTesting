Available lead statuses:
- CONNECTED - INTERESTED:
  * "vvi" - very very interested (customer shows strong buying intent, asks for pricing, wants to proceed immediately)
  * "maybe" - maybe (customer shows some interest but needs more information or time to decide)
  * "enrolled" - enrolled (customer has completed enrollment/purchase process)

- CONNECTED - NOT INTERESTED:
  * "junk_lead" - junk lead (wrong person, spam, or completely irrelevant)
  * "not_required" - not required (customer doesn't need the product/service)
  * "enrolled_other" - enrolled other (customer already has similar service elsewhere)
  * "decline" - decline (customer explicitly refuses or declines the offer)
  * "not_eligible" - not eligible (customer doesn't meet criteria for the service)
  * "wrong_number" - wrong number (reached wrong person or number)

- CONNECTED - FOLLOWUP:
  * "hot_followup" - hot followup (interested customer who wants to be contacted again soon)
  * "cold_followup" - cold followup (lukewarm interest, follow up later)
  * "schedule" - schedule (customer wants to schedule a specific time for next contact)

- NOT CONNECTED:
  * "not_connected" - not connected (call didn't connect properly or no meaningful conversation)

Analyze the conversation for:
1. Customer engagement level
2. Buying signals or objections
3. Explicit statements about interest/disinterest
4. Requests for information or next steps
5. Completion of any enrollment process

Return ONLY the lead status code (e.g., "vvi", "maybe", "decline", etc.). No explanation needed.`
